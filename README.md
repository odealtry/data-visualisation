# data-visualisation
**Having worked through McKinney's 'Python for Data Analysis', I am now developing my own data visualisation projects, including a recreation of the geography of New York using Uber trip data and an analysis of historic arrest info.**

NB - GitHub seems not to be able to render Jupyter Notebook. To see my code, please go to [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the full GitHub URL of the project you'd like to see into the searchbar at the top of the page!
